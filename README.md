My first C programming

C programming is a powerful and widely used programming language that has been around since the early 1970s.
It was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs for developing the Unix operating system.

Basic Structure:
C programs are composed of functions.
A C program starts executing from the main() function

Data Types: C supports various data types, such as int, float, double, char, etc.

Variables and Constants: Variables are used to store data, and constants are values that do not change during the program execution.

Operators: C provides a variety of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.

Control Flow: C supports control flow statements such as if, else, switch, while, do-while, and for loops.
